CycleRank-dev
-------------

This repository is the development version of [the main CycleRank repo](https://github.com/CycleRank/cyclerank). It is as well a companion for the paper "CycleRank, or There and Back Again: Personalized Relevance Scores from Cyclic Paths on Directed Graphs". 


_**Everything in this repository has been written to be used solely by the authors of the paper. Everything is experimental and, possibly, radioactive. You have been warned.**_

The idea is that we like that all the code is out there in the open, however, we recognize that this code can be unreadable, undocumented, or just plain awful.

If you want a more readable, human-friendly version of the code you should head to [the main CycleRank repo](https://github.com/CycleRank/cyclerank). If there is interest we may polish some of the code in here and put it there once it becomes more reasonable.
